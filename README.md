# APOD-web-app

Welcome to my project!

This is a repo of my full stack web application. It is using MERN architecture. Client side (React.js) is used to show user the website and interact with external NASA. The user can add comments about the website that are stored on MongoDb database.

Additional Node.js libraries:
- path
- cors
- dotenv

# Demo

Side note: Of course it also shows the picture of the day, but at this date there wasn't any so there is none.

# Future plans

I will for sure host this website. I will do it on my VPS Server, I just have to set up some stuff.
